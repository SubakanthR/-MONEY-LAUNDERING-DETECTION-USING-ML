# Anti-Money Laundering Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing financial transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies associated with potential money laundering activities. The goal is to support risk assessment and fraud detection using data analysis techniques and machine learning models.

The project emphasizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature-based insights, with machine learning used as a supporting tool for classification.

## Problem Statement
Money laundering poses significant risks to financial institutions and regulatory compliance. Detecting suspicious transactions requires analyzing large volumes of transactional data to identify unusual patterns and high-risk behavior.

This project aims to:
- Analyze transaction data for hidden patterns and anomalies
- Identify potentially suspicious activities
- Support decision-making through data-driven insights

---

## Dataset
- Transaction-level financial data
- Includes attributes such as transaction amount, frequency, time-based behavior, and customer-related features
- Dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

*(Note: Dataset used for academic and learning purposes)*

## Approach

### 1. Data Analysis
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction behavior
- Identified trends, distributions, and correlations across financial features
- Detected anomalous transaction patterns indicating potential risk

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created derived features based on transaction frequency and monetary patterns
- Normalized and transformed data for better model performance

### 3. Machine Learning
- Applied classification models to identify high-risk transactions
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics
- Used ML as a decision-support mechanism rather than a standalone solution
